# Redis + FastAPI

This is a simple application that uses Redis to cache FastAPI responses.

## Start

Task up: To start the application, run the following command.

Task down: To stop the application, run the following command.

## Components

- Redis: A key-value store.
- FastAPI: A web framework.

## Use Case

- Caching: To cache FastAPI responses, so that we can serve the same response to multiple requests and save some resources and time.

I am like Elio, I rather die than to speak.
